# Stock Resistance Chart Requirements

## Question
I want to create a chart to mapout resistance for a stock. what do I need for it?

## Data Requirements for Stock Resistance Mapping

### 1. Historical Price Data
- **OHLC Data (Open, High, Low, Close)**: Essential for identifying price levels
  - Time intervals: 1min, 5min, 15min, 1hr, 4hr, daily
  - Historical depth: At least 3-6 months for meaningful resistance levels
- **Volume Data**: To validate resistance levels (high volume at resistance = stronger level)
- **Timestamp**: For accurate time-series plotting

### 2. Key Price Levels
- **Previous Highs**: Local and global maxima that act as resistance
- **Round Numbers**: Psychological levels (e.g., $100, $150, $200)
- **Moving Averages**: 20, 50, 100, 200-day MAs as dynamic resistance
- **Fibonacci Retracements**: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% levels
- **Pivot Points**: Daily/weekly/monthly pivot calculations

### 3. Technical Indicators
- **Support/Resistance Zones**: Price ranges where stock repeatedly bounces
- **Trend Lines**: Connecting swing highs to form resistance lines
- **Bollinger Bands**: Upper band as dynamic resistance

### 4. Market Context Data
- **Sector Performance**: Industry resistance levels
- **Market Cap**: For relative strength analysis
- **News Events**: Earnings, announcements that create resistance
- **Options Data**: Strike prices with high open interest

### 5. Chart Visualization Requirements
- **Price Chart**: Candlestick or line chart as base
- **Horizontal Lines**: For static resistance levels
- **Trend Lines**: For dynamic resistance
- **Color Coding**: Different colors for different types of resistance
- **Annotations**: Labels for resistance level values
- **Time Frame Selector**: Switch between different time intervals

### 6. Calculation Methods
- **Peak Detection Algorithm**: Identify local maxima
- **Clustering Algorithm**: Group nearby resistance levels
- **Strength Scoring**: Rate resistance based on:
  - Number of touches
  - Volume at level
  - Time since last test
  - Percentage of price rejections

### 7. Data Sources Needed
- **Real-time Price Feed**: For current resistance testing
- **Historical Database**: For backtesting resistance levels
- **Volume Data**: For validation
- **Corporate Actions**: Splits, dividends affecting price levels

### 8. Implementation Considerations
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time vs delayed data
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms for large datasets
- **Accuracy**: Proper handling of gaps and splits
- **User Interface**: Interactive resistance level management
